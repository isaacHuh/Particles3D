Controls:

	- SPACE to spawn block
	- R to erase blocks and reset
	- ESCAPE to end demo

Objectives
- Intro: Fade into scene

- Main Content: 
	- Use the controls above to spawn blocks 
	that interact with each other in 
	different ways

	- Blocks check collision with other blocks and
	detection was optimized to use a simplified form of
	spatial partitioning and assign whether to render the
	block as blocks that are surrounded by other blocks don't 
	need to be rendered or check collision
	
	- Different visual effect is used for water

	- Blocks behave differently depending on type of block

	- water and lava blocks colliding creates smoke

	- rock blocks sink to the bottom and displaces water and lava

- Outro: Fade out of scene after pressing ESCAPE
